# From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter

## About 

A joint effort between members of the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics ([BAND](https://bandframework.github.io)) collaboration and Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification (Errors in Your EFT) 
([BUQEYE](https://buqeye.github.io)) collaboration to perform principled uncertainty quantification of the dense matter equation of state (EOS) using the novel techniques 
in Bayesian model mixing (BMM). 

## Installing the repository and its dependencies

This repository is built to work off of the nuclear-matter-convergence repository of the BUQEYE collaboration, [found here](https://github.com/buqeye/nuclear-matter-convergence). As such, it has some dependencies that need to be built in the virtual environment before this repository can be run. Follow the steps below to complete this installation.

1. Create a new Conda environment: `conda create -n BUQEYE python==3.9.16`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate BUQEYE`
3. Install jupyterlab and jupyter notebook: `conda install jupyterlab, jupyter notebook`
4. Clone this repository by copying the link in the code tab above: `git clone https://github.com/asemposki/EOS_BMM_SNM.git`
5. Within the above repository folder, git clone gsum: `git clone https://github.com/buqeye/gsum.git` and pip install this in gsum directory using `pip install .`
6. Also within the repository folder, git clone gptools: `git clone https://github.com/markchil/gptools.git` and pip install this in the gptools directory using `pip install .`
7. Still within this repository's main folder, git clone the nuclear-matter-convergence repo using `git clone https://github.com/buqeye/nuclear-matter-convergence.git` and `pip install .` within the nuclear-matter-convergence folder
8. Lastly, git clone the BAND package `Taweret` from `https://github.com/bandframework/Taweret.git` within the repository's main folder, as before
9. Now that this is all done, you can test the structure by going into the `notebooks` folder and saying `jupyter notebook` in terminal, and this should load up the notebooks to be run. You should be all set!
